Generally, yaml files containing coding questions can be imported (not implemented yet), and created. For instance, to initialize a yaml file in the root directory:

```{r create_function}
create_question("Random Sequencing Question","~/.","Jeremy Fan")
```

In the future, more specific options for what kind of questions will be added, lesson "streams" will be also added to address individuals beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.
